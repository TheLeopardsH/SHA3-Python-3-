# SHA3-Python-3-
Python 3 code for SHA-3 cryptographic algorithm
This code has clean and easy to understand the implementation of SHA-3 Cryptographic Algorithm.Comments are done to make it easier to understand for someone who is new to SHA-3 and python


![SHA-3 High Level Overview](https://github.com/TheLeopardsH/SHA3-Python-3-/blob/master/SHA3.png)

There are four levels of security in SHA-3 as follows

| Type        |  Output Length   |  Rate (r)     |    Capacity (c)   |
| ----------- |  --------------- | ------------- |  ---------------  | 
| SHA3-224    |       224        |    1152       |       448         |
| SHA3-256    |       256        |    1088       |       512         |
| SHA3-384    |       384        |     832       |       768         |
| SHA3-512    |       512        |     576       |      1024         |

Stage 1:
       Stage 1 is Padding stage
       
Stage 2:
       Stage 2 is State size
 
Stage 3:
       Stage 3 is Aborbing phase
       
Stage 4:
       Stage 4 is Squeezing phase
